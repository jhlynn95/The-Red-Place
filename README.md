## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to go to a website, click on the different sections on the navigation bar, and be redirected to the appropriate page. Also, to see the menu, their location, and hours, find out their story, and also see if they provide catering services so that I may do business with them.

## Description 
In today's day and age, with technology ever increasing, the need for businesses to have a website has increased. The majority of customers, have smart phones and computers which they use to browse the web and shop for their favorite goods online. Restaurants have picked up on this and have given customers the ability to check out the menus, order ahead, display their location, hours and also giving the option for catering events. As a group, we wanted to test the skills we have learned and push ourselves to make The Red Place website that has a React front-end, using GraphQL, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for database purposes. We have also incorporated JWT for authentication and utilizing queries and mutations for adding, updating and deleting necessary data. Our team has excellent communication skills, assigned tasks and helped each other when needed.
